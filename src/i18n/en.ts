  // FAQ
  faqTitle: "Frequently Asked Questions",
  faqPricingTitle: "Pricing",
  faqPricingQ1: "How does the pricing work?",
  faqPricingA1: "Our price starts at $1,000 and increases every second. When someone makes a purchase, the price resets to $1,000. This creates a dynamic market where timing matters. You can lock the current price by paying a 5% deposit.",
  faqPricingQ2: "Why does the price keep going up?",
  faqPricingA2: "The increasing price reflects the scarcity of our time and availability. It creates urgency and rewards decisive clients. The longer you wait, the more you pay. But when someone buys, everyone gets a fresh start at $1,000.",
  faqPricingQ3: "Is there a maximum price?",
  faqPricingA3: "There is no hard maximum, but practically the price resets frequently enough that it rarely reaches extreme levels. The market naturally regulates itself through purchases.",
  faqDepositTitle: "Deposits",
  faqDepositQ1: "What happens after I pay the deposit?",
  faqDepositA1: "After your deposit is received: 1) The counter resets to $1,000 for everyone. 2) We review your project description. 3) We contact you within 24 hours. 4) We schedule a consultation call. 5) We discuss your project and decide if it's a good fit.",
  faqDepositQ2: "Can I get my deposit back?",
  faqDepositA2: "Yes, if WE decline your project (e.g., it's outside our expertise). No, if YOU change your mind after paying. The deposit ensures both parties are serious. See our Refund Policy for complete details.",
  faqFlashDropTitle: "Flash Drop",
  faqFlashDropQ1: "What is Flash Drop?",
  faqFlashDropA1: "Flash Drop is a monthly event where our price crashes to $100 for exactly 15 minutes. It's our way of making services accessible. The date and time are kept secret - only newsletter subscribers get notified when it happens.",
  faqFlashDropQ2: "How do I get notified about Flash Drop?",
  faqFlashDropA2: "Subscribe to our newsletter on the homepage. When a Flash Drop is about to happen, subscribers receive an email notification. Be quick - spots fill fast at that price!",
  faqSocialPriceTitle: "Social Price",
  faqSocialPriceQ1: "What is Social Price Mode?",
  faqSocialPriceA1: "Social Price Mode is an alternative pricing mechanism where the price is determined by engagement on specific TikTok content. Higher engagement can unlock different pricing. It's an experimental way to reward social participation.",
  faqProcessTitle: "Process",
  faqProcessQ1: "What kind of projects do you accept?",
  faqProcessA1: "We specialize in web development, web applications, and custom software. We review each project individually. If your project is outside our expertise, we'll refund your deposit. Describe your project in detail during checkout for the best assessment.",
  faqProcessQ2: "How long does a project take?",
  faqProcessA2: "Timelines vary based on project complexity and are discussed during our consultation call. We don't provide estimates until we fully understand your requirements. Rush projects may be possible at the developer's discretion.",
